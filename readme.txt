Hey guys!

Please be sure do the following commands:

pip install bootstrap
pip install flask_bootstrap

If you have any questions on how to copy a base template and use it please reference me or: https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Bootstrap/basic-usage.html#templates


{% block content %}
    <h1> Please be sure to include these block headers on all the html files you create. Or please select a template that is already made. </h1>


    Templates can be found:
    https://startbootstrap.com/previews/modern-business/
    most of our templates are created already just need to be edited.


{% endblock %}


CHANGES:
    response.html has been updated to incorporate bootstrap template (default template has not been agreed on but will be contained in "base.html")
    This file will be extended to all of our created html files by including {% extends "bootstrap/base.html" %} at the very beginning of the file!

    Deandra is going to update >>"Portfolio Heading"<< section on homepage (located in index.html)
        To incorporate access to meals generated by our api


PROBLEMS FACING:
    Currently the questioner is having problems stating:
        AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'key'
        @ Brianna can you look into this when you get the opportunity?
            Need the response from the questioner to move forward with @app.route('/recipes')


THINGS TO CLARIFY:
    What pages do we need to have completed before our checkpoint deadline?
    When can we get this pushed to heroku?
    How do you all want to go about handling the excess pages we have with template?
    What will our default template be for new pages or are we using it on a need basis?
    What do we need clarification on from our managers?
